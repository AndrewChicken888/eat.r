eat.r - Restaurant Randomizer

v.1.0.0
This version allows the user to select from a variety of 15 restaurants with 7 categories that can select and deselect numerous restaurants at a time. The user can then press a button to randomly select and display one of the selected restaurants. The purpose of this program is to help my family decide on a restaurant when they are unable to decide amongst themselves.
